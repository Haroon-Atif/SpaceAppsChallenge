In order to achieve global coverage,
any surface radiation
climatology
has to be based on
satellite observations.
In the last decade several schemes
have been devised to obtain the surface
solar insolation
from top of the atmosphere
reflected
solar radiation
(Tarpley,
1979; Gautier et
al., 1980).
More recently,
attempts
have been made to infer the components
of longwave
radiation
at the surface from satellite sounder data using a radiative
transfer
model (Schmetz
et
al., 1986; Frouin et al., 1988; Gupta,
1989).
In addition to the radiative
transfer
scheme,
these
methods require
assumptions
about the effective
emitting
temperature
of cloud tops and bases.
The one common
theme in these methods
is an assumption
regarding
the vertical
extent of the
cloudiness
detected
in the upwelling
radiation.
Once the top is placed
using a coincident
sounding,
the position
of the base is estimated
by various
methods,
the simplest
being an
assumption
of constant cloud depth.
During the day, the reflected
solar radiation
has also been
used to estimate
the geometric
depth
of the cloud layer (Frouin
et al., 1988),
a complex
procedure
that involves assumptions
regarding
cloud microphysics
and morphology.
Modeling
studies
have shown
that although
there are strong correlations
between
the
solar upwelling
radiative
flux and surface flux, this is not true of the longwave
(Ramanathan,
1986).
However,
if the clear sky component
is considered
separately
such that the cloud
longwave
forcing at the top and at the surface are compared,
a slightly different
picture emerges.
Figure 1 shows the monthly mean simulated
longwave
radiation
at the top of the atmosphere
and
at the surface
from a general
circulation
model
(Harshvardhan
et al., 1989).
Each point
represents
a 4 ° latitude
x 5 ° longitude
grid.
During the simulation,
in addition
to the hourly
radiative
fields generated
as part of the model integration,
a clear sky computation
was also
made every hour. The difference,
which is the cloud forcing, was thus obtained
at the top of the
atmosphere
and the surface.
Figure 2 shows the longwave
cloud radiative
forcing at these levels
for all the grid points in the model.
This figure contains information
on the relationship
between
emission
from the cloud tops and bases in the model.
For example,
a subset of the simulated
data for two latitude
bands is shown in Figures
3 and 4. Figure
3 is for a region of high
convective
clouds and the cloud radiative
forcing at the top is very large when cloudiness
occurs
where as the surface longwave
fluxes are not affected
much.
Figure 4 is for a region of low
clouds such that the cloud top emission
is not too different
from the surface emission
but the
downward
longwave
radiation
is altered quite drastically
in the presence
of clouds.
During the FIRE Cirrus IFO, surface radiation
measurements
were made at several sites
and co-incident
satellite
overpass
data was also collected
(LeCroy
et al., 1989).
It may be
possible
to extract
the longwave
cloud radiative
forcing
at the top and the surface
from these
data.
If relationships,
such as shown in Figures
3 and 4 are verifiable
by observations,
this
information
can be useful for the extraction
of the surface longwave
radiation
from satellite data.
The radiative
transfer
schemes
used to convert upwelling
spectral radiances
into a downwelling
longwave
radiation
can provide the clear sky component.
The cloud radiative
forcing at the top
of the atmosphere
can then modify the surface fluxes according
to relationships
shown in Figures
3 and 4. It should be noted that this procedure
may be considered
only for temporal
averages
and not for instantaneous
deductions
of surface fluxes.
This would be most useful in compiling
monthly

mean

regional

climatologies

of the surface

longwave

fluxes.
