During
the 1987 FIRE
marine
stratocumulus
experiment
the
U.K.
Meteorological
Office
operated
a set of turbulence
probes
attached
to
the tether
cable of a balloon
based on San Nicolas
Island.
Typically
six
probes
were
used;
each
probe
is
fitted
with
Gill propeller
anemometers,
a
platinum
resistance
thermometer
and
wet
and
dry
thermistors,
to permit
measurements
of the fluxes
of momentum,
heat and
humidity.
The orientation
of each probe is determined
from a
pair
of
inclinometers
and a three-axis
magnetometer.
Sufficient
information
is
available
to allow
the measured
wind velocities
to be corrected
for the
motion
of
the
balloon.
A full description
of this turbulence
system
can be found in Lapworth
and Mason
(1988).
On the 14th/15th
July
measurements
were
made
over
the
period
1530-0200
UTC
and
again,
after
a short break
for battery
re-charging
and topping-up
the balloon,
between
0400-0800
UTC.
Data were
therefore
recorded
from
morning
to
early
evening,
and
again
for
a period
overnight.
Six probes
were available
for
the
daytime
measurements,
five
for the night.
Data were
recorded
at 4 _z for individual
periods
of a little
over an hour.
The intention
was to keep a minimum

The most direct
comparison,
and contrast,
can be drawn
between
the
overnight
period
and
that around
local noon.
In both cases
the mean
inversion
height
was very similar
and the
parameter
u./fz,
(=R)
was
equal
to',_3.5.
This parameter,
being proportional
to the _atio of the
height
of a steady

layer
to
that
of
the

is
useful
in establishing
the broad
relationship
between

and those of other
experiments.

(giving
a spatial
resolution
of NI70
metres),
with the mean horizontal
wind subtracted.
The daytime
data of
Figure
I are from 1908-1958
UTC (i.e.
immediately
before
local
noon)
and correspond
to an horizontal
length
scale of 18km, based on the mean
wind.
The upper 2 levels
were above cloud,
while
the
third
was
just
below
cloud
top; the cloud
base in this period
varied
from about
220 to
300 metres.
The
nocturnal
data
in
Figure
2
were
taken
between
0645-0738
UTC, and again
correspond
to a length
scale of 18km;
the top
level
is just below cloud
top and
cloud
base
was
approximately
140
metres.
There
is a striking
contrast
in the degree
of variability
between
the
velocity
fields
in
Figures
1
and
2.

draughts;
however,
at night
the magnitudes
of these gust velocities
are
much higher
and coherent
structures
occupy
the
whole
depth
of
the
boundary
layer,
rather
than just the cloud layer.
Turbulent
statistics
were
calculated
from
2-hour
periods,
one
straddling
local
noon
and one at night.
These were sub-divided
into
half-hour
averaging
intervals
for
the
evaluation
of
variances
and
fluxes.
The
vertical
velocity
variances
for the day (closed
squares)
and night
(open triangles)
are plotted
on Figure
3;
the
heights
have
been
normalised
by
the
inversion
height.
The
daytime
profile
characteristically
shows
very
low
values
above
cloud,
a
distinct
maximum
in the cloud layer
and evidence
of a second
weak maximum
below
cloud.
In contrast,
the nocturnal
data show
a
more
turbulent
layer
well-mixed
from inversion
to surface
in a manner
analogous
to that of a
convective
boundary
layer
heated
from
below
(e.g.
Lenschow
et
ai,1980).
These

features

are

also

reflected

in

the

behaviour

of

the

equivalent
potential
temperature
flux, shown in Figure
4.
During
both
day and night
the flux maxima
are located
close to cloud
top;
however,
whereas
the nocturnal
data give the appearance
of a single
mixed
layer
driven
by a cloud-top
buoyancy
flux,
the
daytime
profile
shows
a
distinct
minimum
in the region
of cloud base increasing
again
to a weak
surface
flux.
The daytime
boundary
layer,
around
local noon,
therefore
consists
of
a
cloud
mixed
layer,
driven
by
a
cloud-top
buoyancy
flux,
surmounting
a
weakly-driven
layer
of
depth_0.2u./fz
,
a
value
reminiscent
of the results
of the JASIN experiment
(e.g. _ Slingo
et al
(1982),
Nicholls(1985)).
The top of this layer,
however,
and the
base
of the cloud mixed layer are not clearly
associated
with cloud
base, as
observed
from the surface,
which
tended
to be variable
and
ill-defined
during
this period.
Mixed-layer
similarity
of the two datasets
can be
shown
by normalising
and repiotting
against
l-z/h,
where
h is the mixed
layer
depth.
The
vertical
velocity
variances
were normalised
by w.,
the convective
velocity
scale,
and the fluxes
by the maximum
value
at
cloud
top.
The
results
are
displayed
on
Figures
5
and
6.
A
satisfactory
collapse
of the data is achieved
except
for
w=
as
l-z/h
approaches
unity;
the
lower
boundary
condition
for the daytime
mixed
layer
will be different
from that at night when w 2 must go to
zero
at
the surface.

The evidence
presented
strongly
supports
the notion
that,
for
at
least
part
of the daytime,
the cloud layer becomes
decoupled
from the
surface
following
the absorption
of solar'radiation
at depth
within
the
cloud
layer.
The
surface
fluxes
on this occasion
are weak and the
growth
of any
surface
Ekman
layer
is
limited.
Further
evidence,
derived
from
the
TKE
budget
and turbulence
length
scales,
for this
argument

will

be

presented.
