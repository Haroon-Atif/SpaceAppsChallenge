Introduction
One of the goals of the First ISCCP Regional
Experiment
(FIRE)
is the
quantification
of the uncertainties
in the cloud parameter
products
derived
by the International
Satellite
Cloud Climatology
Project
(ISCCP).
This
validation
effort
has many facets
including
sensitivity
analyses
(Rossow
et
al., 1989) and comparisons
to similar
data or theoretical
results
with known
accuracies.
The FIRE provides
cloud-truth
data at particular
points
or
along
particular
lines from surface
and aircraft
measurement
systems.
Relating
these data to the larger,
area-averaged
ISCCP results
requires
intermediate
steps using higher
resolution
satellite
data analyses.
Errors
in the cloud products
derived
with a particular
method
can be determined
by
performing
analyses
of high-resolution
satellite
data over the area
surrounding
the point or llne measurement.
This same analysis
technique
may
then be used to derive
cloud parameters
over a larger
area containing
similar
cloud
fields.
It is assumed
that the uncertainties
found for the
small-scale
analyses
are the same for the large
scale so that the method
has
been
"calibrated
_ for the particular
cloud
type; i.e., its accuracy
is
known.
Differences
between
the large-scale
results
using
the ISCCP
technique
and the "calibrated"
method
can be computed
and used to determine
if any significant
biases
or rms errors
occur
in the ISCCP results.
In this
paper,
selected
ISCCP results
are compared
to cloud parameters
derived
using
the hybrid
bispectral
threshold
method
HBTH
(Minnis
et al., 1987)
over the
FIRE IFO and extended
observation
areas.

ISCCP B3 data taken every 3 hours
during
July 17-31,
1983
analyzed

the HBTM on a 2.5 ° latitude-longltude

40°N and
IO°N and 145°W and II0°W (Minnis
et al., 1988) are compared
to the

been
middle,

and high clouds
are those with cloud-top
pressures
p > 800 mb, 800 mb _ p >
440 mb, and
p ! 440 mb, respectively.
HBTM low, middle,
and high clouds
are those with cloud-top
altitudes,
z < 2 km, 2 km _ z < 6 km, and
z _ 6
km.
There are two primary
types of ISCCP cloud cover,
VIR, determined
with
visible
and infrared
data, and IR, determined
with
infrared-data
alone.
The
two cloud amounts
are the same at night.
As noted by Minnis
et al. (1988),
the cloud amounts,
diurnal
cloud variations,
and cloud-top
heights
do not
vary dramatically
on an interannual
basis
over this area.
Also,
the cloud
properties
derived
from the satellite
near the coast are very much like
those
determined
over the open ocean within
this grid.
Thus,
the largescale
average
properties
determined

areas.

low, and sum of middle
increase
from the
130°W with a relative

and

maximum
in low cloudiness
within
the IFO region.
This extensive
cover of
low clouds
is referred
to as the main stratocumulus
region.
Significant
amounts
of upper-level
clouds
occur in the southeastern
quadrant
of the
grid.
Differences
between
the HBTM and VlR results
are shown
in Fig. 2,
while
the HBTM-IR
differences
are plotted
in Fig. 3.
Neglecting
the land
areas,
the mean VIR total cloud amounts
(Fig. 2a) are 2 ± 6% greater
than
the HBTM values.
Most of the ISCCP clouds,
however,
are placed
in the
middle
layer as seen in the differences
in Figs. 2b and 2c.
More clouds
are
found with the HBTM over the main stratocumulus
region
than with the IR
results.
The IR underestimates
total cloudiness
by 7 ± 11%.
The differences
in the 3-hourly
means are examined
in Fig. 4 for two
large
regions
outlined
in heavy
lines in Fig. ic.
The western
box is
designated
the PAC region,
while
the other is the IFO region.
Over the PAC
region
(Fig. 4a), there is generally
good agreement
between
the results
for
all three
analysis
techniques.
The HBTM cloudiness
is very close
to the IR
results
during
the day but greater
at night.
Addition
of the visible
data
increases
the ISCCP cloud amounts
so the VIR cloud cover exceeds
the HBTM
amounts
during
the day.
On average,
the HBTM and IR cloud amounts
are the
same, while
the VIR cloudiness
is greater
than the HBTM's.
This tendency
for slight
daytime
overestimation
by the VlR technique
(relative
to the
HBTM)
and underestimation
with the IR method
is accentuated
near the coast
over the IFO region
(Fig. 4b).
There,
the IR diurnal
range
is much smaller
than the HBTM's
with a 20% underestimate
in total cloudiness
at night and
more than 10% during
the day.
The VlR data only underestimate
the cloud
cover
during
the night
leading
to an overall
cloud amount
deficit
of 10%.
The overestimation
of ISCCP cloud-top
heights
over the stratocumulus
region
is probably
due to the use of low-resolution
NMC soundings
over areas
with strong
boundary-layer
inversions
(Minnis
et al., 1989b).
The VIR cloud
amounts
agree quite well with the HBTM results
primarily
because
of the
effects
result

of underestimation
is consistent
with

at
the

night and overestimation
during
the day.
Landsat
analyses
of Parker
and Wielicki

This

(1989).
The differences
between
the results
over the PAC and FIRE regions
are attributable
to the variations
in contrast
between
the clear-sky
and
cloudy
temperatures.
Near the coast,
the clouds
are lower than those
further
west so fewer pixels
are cold enough
to pass the 3-K threshold.
Diurnal
variations
in cloud amount
determined
with either
the VIR or IR
techniques
should
be used carefully.
While both techniques
appear
the correct
times
for maximum
and minimum
cloudiness,
there may be
significant
discrepancies
in the diurnal
ranges
and the variations
cloudiness
between
the extrema.

Another
method
for validating
an algorithm
is to apply it directly
to a
high-resolutlon
satellite
data set corresponding
to a cloud-truth
set.
The

was not available
for this study so an attempt
is
made here to simulate
its relevant
