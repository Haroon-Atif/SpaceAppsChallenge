Introduction

On July 5 (NCAR

Electra flight 4, Mission 186-G) the Electra flew a single aircraft mission
legs at 6 different altitudes between 10:43 -- 16:00 PDT (17:43 --23:00

This abstract presents sea surface temperature
measurements
and conservative
variable analyses for several of
the July 5 legs. These results are preliminary
to a study of the thermodynamic
budget on July 5; they indicate that:

dropped

more than 1 K (from 17.3°C

to 15.9°C)

over the course

of the

GMT).

Mixing lines for each of the horizontal sub-cloud legs show the effect of a strong north-south
gradient
in SST. The source points for the observed mixtures have SSTs colder than those observed
in the
flight area.
There is a clear demarcation
over a transition of 5-10 km between air to the south and cooler, (AT=
--0.3°C)
moister (Arv = 1 g/kg) air to the north. The FSSP measurements
indicate there are small
clouds/scud
250 m below cloud base on the cold northern side of this transition.
The transition is
seen in the saturation point diagrams at 984 mb, 959 mb, and 946 mb. There is no corresponding
change in the horizontal
wind across the transition regions.

Observations

Figure 1 shows the height/latitude
cross sections of the flight tracks. Also shown is the time at the mid-point
of the track, the pressure level (in mb), and the aircraft direction of travel. The stars indicate the location of the
transition between air masses mentioned
above in item (3).

measurements

from

two of the surface

legs are shown

in

Figure 2a (18:01 -- 18:21) and 2b (21:56 -- 22:08 GMT). The technique of Liu and Katsaros (1980) has been used
to correct for emission from overlying clouds. The SST measurements
show a strong north-south
SST gradient late
in the flight, and a 1 K cooling

(or 1 K radiometer

drift) over the 4 hours of the flight.

An independent
check of the SST measurement
is provided by the mixing diagrams in Figures 3a and 3b. We
have used the saturation point notation of Betts (1982), with (0., Q.) denoting the potential temperature
and total
water mixing ratio of air taken to its lifting condensation
level. These variables
mix linearly and are conserved
under adiabatic transformations,
i.e. air that is a mixture from two sources will have values of (0,, Q.) that fail on
a line between the two source points. The saturation points of 3 representative
SSTs are also shown; it appears from
these mixing diagrams that the surface

Also striking in both 3a and 3b is the separation of the saturation points into two distinct groups. The separation
is observed in each of three sub-cloud legs. Figure 4 shows the temperature,
mixing ratio, and droplet concentration
measurements
for the 984 mb penetration. The lower 0. branch in Figure 3a is composed of points sampled over
the last 2.5 minutes of the time series shown in Figure 4. The radiometric
temperature measurement
from the PRT6
is included.
It indicates that the observed cooling
