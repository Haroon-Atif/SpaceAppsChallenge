and 4 summarize
their results.
The ozone response
is seen to reach a maximum
of about
0.5% near the 2 mbar level for a 1% change in the 205 nm flux. Actual peak-to-peak
ozone
mixing ratio changes were as large as 3% corresponding
to maximum
205 nm flux changes of
6-7% on the 27-day time scale. The temperature
response maximizes
near the stratopause
and amounts to 0.06% (about 0.17 K) for a 1% change in the 20S nm flux. Actual peak-topeak temperature
changes were as large as 1 K. Formal error limits for each time interval
represent standard
deviations
from the mean of separate estimates
for the five 10 ° latitude
zones between
25°S and 25°N. As shown in Figure 3, ozone response

The solid lines

et al. (1987) using
a one-dimensional

code.
This simulation
is in
qualitative
agreement
with the measurements
but the amplitude
of the calculated
ozone
response
is noticeably
less than the observed response
above about 5 mbar.
It has been
suggested
that a part of the difference between
the model result and the observed
ozone
response is due to the use of diurnally averaged photodissociation
rates in the model calculations.
HOOD and DOUGLASS
(1989) have reported calculations
using a parameterized
perturbation-order
radiative photochemical
model but using a variable solar zenith range
in the photodissociation
calculations
that is more appropriate
for comparison
with the
SBUV measurements.

ratio) decreases by approximately
6% between solar maximum
in 1980-1981
and late 1984
(Figure 1). Adopting
this flux variation,
the same radiative
photochemical
code used to
produce
the dashed line model of Figure 3 for the 27-day time scale may be applied in
order to estimate the expected solar cycle variation of ozone mixing ratio at levels between
3 and 10 mbar and at equatorial
latitudes.
Results
show predicted
mean ozone mixing
ratio decreases
of 2.0% at 3 mbar, 2.3% at 4.5 mbar, and 0.8% at 10 mbar for the interval
between
solar maximum
in 1980 and solar minimum
in 1985.
Such decreases
would be
small in comparison
to seasonal variations
and would be difficult to detect relative to other
natural sources of variability
such as the E1 Chichon volcanic eruption.
The net change in
the ozone column at low latitudes
resulting directly from these upper stratospheric
mixing
ratio decreases
would be less than 1%.
Although
radiative-photochemical
models can yield an approximate
agreement
with
the observed ozone responses
and phase lags below 3 mbar,
it is unlikely that the large
