The very close agreement
between
the measurements
and theory shows
that, in this case, the absorption
of solar radiation
by the clouds can be accounted for largely by the droplets and that the large drops (drizzle)
did not
produce
significant
"anomalous
absorption."
Based on these results we are
forced to conclude
that "anomalous
absorption,"
as discussed
by Twomey
(1976), Davies et al. (1984) and Stephens and Tsay (1989), was not significant in
the marine stratocumulus
clouds that we sampled on 10 July 1987.
