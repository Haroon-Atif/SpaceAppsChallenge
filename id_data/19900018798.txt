16. Abstract

Graphite/epoxy
panels with S-glass buffer strips were tested in tension and shear to measure their residual
strengths
with crack-like
damage. The buffer strips were regularly
spaced narrow strips of continuous
Sglass. Panels were made with a uniweave
graphite cloth where the S-glass buffer material was woven
directly into the cloth. Panels were made with different width and thickness
buffer strips. The panels wer(
loaded to failure while remote strain, strain at the end of the slit, and crack opening displacement
were
monitored.
The notched region and nearby buffer strips were radiographed
periodically
to reveal crack
growth

and damage.

Except for panels with short slits, the buffer strips arrested the propagating
crack. The strength (or failing
strain) of the panels was significantly
higher than the strength of all-graphite
panels with the same length
slit. Panels with wide, thick buffer strips were stronger than panels with thin, narrow buffer strips. A
shear-lag
model predict the failing strength of tension panels with wide buffer strips accurately,
but overestimated
the strength of the shear panels and the tension panels with narrow buffer strips.
