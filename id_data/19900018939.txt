PARAMETERIZATION

Since longwave cooling off cloud top is the important
driving mechanism
in the cloudtopped marine boundary
layer, the radiation
paramaterization
warrants
a detailed description. We follow the philosophy
that, consistent
with the limitation
of the vertical thermodynamic structure
to two degrees of freedon, the vertical resolution
of the radiative
cooling
should also be limited to two degrees of freedom.
This means radiation
can appear at most
in the mixed layer thermal
budget equation,
and the cloud top jump condition.
This is
slightly more general than Lilly's restriction
of the radiative
cooling to the cloud top jump
condition.
Thus, we write the equations
for the changes in radiative
fluxes across cloud top
and across the mixed layer as

The method we have chosen to use in solving
for the steady-state

to one equation
in H.
We can then use a simple secant method
