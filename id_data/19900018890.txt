Abstract.
The possiOility
to detect
the
c_'omospheric
flares
based"on
the natural
VLF
emission
intensity
data on _he _arth's
surface
is considered.
Diagnostics
of the change
of solar
A-ray
burst
flux at 0.5-4
_° and its estimation
are discussed
as possible.
The effect
of solar
flare
short-wave
emission
on the _arth's
ionosphere
was considered
oy A.I._itra (1977)
where
the determination
of solar
X-ray
fluxes
by indirect
me,hods
is described.
In
low-frequency
range
for this aim are used
the signals
of transmitters
operating
at tens-hundreds
kilohertz
Xrequencies.
The records
of tne natural
emlssion
Latmospherics)
are considered
to be suitable for the Oetection
of f±ares
but to be hardly
used
for the investigation
of ionosphere
physics
as the detected
noise
represents
the integral
effect
of many sources
and the sources
are of a random character.
Here
the possibility
is studied
of the de_ection
of solar
chromospheric
flares
and _he
estimation
of A-ray
flux
accon_anied
by
powerful
bursts
in the range
O.5-4,
I-8 _
based
on the change
of
the regular
noise
background
intensity
of the natural
low-frequency emission
detected
on the Earth.
For m_n3 years
in Yakutsk
( _ = 62°N;
_ = 129,7°_)
_he
natur_l
_LF-VLF
emission
at 0.5-I0
:_z is being
detected
con_inlously.
One
of _he types
of continious
low-frequency
emission
is a regular
noise
background
(I_B)
determined
as a separate
class
(V_rshinin,
Ponom-_rev,
1966).
_d_B is is available
constantly
on the records
and is characterized
by a smooth
temporal
rounding.
A spectral
distribution
of id_B intensity
is two emission
bands
in ELF-VLF
ranges
divided
by a deep minimum
at 2-_ kHz (Liurzaeva,
1974).
r'or the analysis
were
used the records
of ELF-VLF
emissions
obtained
in Yakutsk
in 197_-197@
by 8-channel
registrator
(Druzhin
at al., 1976)
and from 1978
to now by l_-channel
registra_or
in
0.5-10
_iz
range.
_esides,
s_ellitc
Oata

X-ray
i'luxes
_ere
used
(SGD,
197_-1985).
A comparison
of P_B r_cords
_;ith solar X-ray
fluxes
_howed
that
the chsnge
of ZLF-VLF
emission
intensity
and its value
depend
on
a value
of X-ray
burst
flux.
Almost
simultsneously
with
solar
X-ray
burst
bhe RNB intensity
increases
at 0.5-_
Idlz and decreases
at
~ _-90 kHz. The enhancement
maximum
is at 0.5-0.8
i_z,
the hi{_hest weakening
- at @-6 ]d{z (_urzaeva,
_977;
1981).
The increase
of
X-ray
flux by an order
of 2-% causes
both
we_<ening
and an enhancemcnt
of ELF-VLF
emission
I_B
intensi_y
from
~ 2-_ to
~15-20

A change
of I{NB intensity
spectral
distribution

_lares
was considered
0y I_urzaeva,
Fligel
(1980;
198_).
In Fig._
is shown _d{B intensity

on 5 flares
in "1975197_
and in _98_ versus

Zn Fig.2 is presented an example of i_lIB intensity change during
a flare at various concrete I requencies of the range unger investigation and solar X-ray ilux record obtained by the satellite
(SGD,
1973). A dynamics of VI_' emission intensity at 5.6 kHz and of X-ray
ilux repeat each other (in counterphase). However, _LF emission intensit_ increase during a flare is not always observed and a frequency at which occurs a transfer from RNB intensity increase to
its decrease is rather variable. Besides, fLF emission intensity
enhancement caused by the influence of enhanced solar X-ray flux
on the ionosphere is hardly different
from ELF emission flare caused
by other types of ionospheric and magnetospheric disturbances. At
the same time a sharp v_eakening of _B intensity at VLF frequencies
observed during chromospheric flares is opposite to _LF emission
bursts and is of a characteristic
for chromospheric flares form.
Therefore to study the variabions of solar X-ray fluxes were used
the experimental data at 5.6 kHz which, besides, appears to be at
frequency range _here lii:B intensity weakening is maximumduring a
flare
and PdB record level is high enough as compared with the instrumen_ noise.
_ometimes during several hours one can observe a number of flare_, for instance, on July 21, 1981. The variations of idB level
caused by them are superposed on its regular daily changes. Nevertheless, (see l,'ig.3) in the behaviour of Pd_B
curve is reflected
the dynamics of flare X-ray zlux. A picture is being clarified
if
to subtrack the daily variations of RNB intensity from the total
c u__v e

course.

;_e carried
out a statistical
treatment
of the experimental
data
on a number
of chromospheric
flares
and estimated
solar
X-ray
flux
during
flares.
In the case when X-ray
fluxes
(F) increase
during
a flare
by an order
of
_ 2 or more
they are as
_'= c_f_/fJ
_
,_here
c
and
_
are determined
based
on the experimental
data.
The estimated
x-ra_
flux
(in the first
approximation)
is shown
in
_ig.3.
A comparison
wibh
the satellite
data (SGD,
1982)
evidences
ibs agreement.
±'hue, using _ata

of the
natural
