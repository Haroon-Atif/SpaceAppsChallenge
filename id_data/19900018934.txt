INTRODUCTION
The

of cloud radiative properties.
The
on clouds and the impact on climate processes
have recently been discussed
by several

authors
(Twomey
et al., 1984; Coakley et al., 1987, Charlson
et al., 1987). Of particular
concern
in this
presentation
is the potential
for observing
variations
of cloud characteristics
that might be related to
variations
of available
aerosols.
The results of comparisons
between
aircraft-measured
microphysical
characteristics
and satellite-detected
radiative properties
of marine stratocumulus
clouds are resented here.
These

results

extracted

from

(1988)

and

Durkee

and

Mineart

(1989)

where

the

analysis

and a full discussion of the observations
are presented.
Due to the space available,
only a brief
of the results will be presented.
The satellite
data used here are from the National
Oceanic
and Atmospheric
Administration

(NOAA)
Advanced
Very High Resolution
Radiometer
(AVHRR)
collected
at the Scripps
Satellite
Oceanography
Facility.
The AVHRR
channel
1 (0.63/_m),
channel 2 (0.86/_m),
channel 3 (3.7 #m), and
channel 4 (11 # m) data were used in the analysis.
Cloud microphysical
data were obtained
by instruments
on the NCAR Electra during cloud-penetrating
missions in support of the field operations
from 29 June 19 July 1988.
RESULTS
Mineart

(1988)

presents

four

case

studies

that

show

a consistent

relationship

between

cloud

microphysical
characteristics
and cloud radiative properties.
The most dominant
effect is observed
in cloud
reflectance
at 3.7/_ m wavelength
(AVHRR
channel 3). Fig. 1 shows the observed
relationship
between
aircraft-measured
cloud droplet
size and satellite-measured
cloud
reflectance.
At this wavelength,
moderate
absorption
by the cloud droplets
limits the dependence
of cloud reflectance
on cloud thickness
and liquid water content
(primary
determinants
of reflectance
at visible wavelengths).
Therefore
the
primary determinant
of cloud brightness
at 3.7 #m is the cloud droplet
size distribution
(reflectance
increases with decreasing
droplet size). The dashed lines in Fig. 1 are the theoretical
relationships
for three
size distributions.
The effects of droplet
size on cloud reflectance
are also theoretically
expected
at shorter
wavelengths

The primary modifier of cloud brightness
at 3.7/_ m wavelength shown in Fig. 1, is influence from
continental
air masses (Mineart,
1988).
Presumably,
continental
air containing
significantly
more CCN
than marine air, produces
clouds with smaller droplets
relative to clouds in typical marine
air masses.
These microphysical
differences
between
marine and continental
clouds can be observed
in the satellitedetected
radiative
properties
of the clouds.

Analysis of CCN measurements

Continental
aerosol

were observed
during

Durkee
(1989) reports several cases of urban influence on aerosol and cloud processes.
These effects
are identified by the spatial and temporal relationships
to urban centers.

Composites
of satellite-measured
radiative characteristics
have been prepared
to assess the largescale effects of continental
aerosol sources on cloud characteristics.

for August
1986.
These results illustrate
a clear distinction
between
cloud reflectance

3.7 #m and 0.63 #m wavelengths.

at the workshop.

CONCLUSIONS

Relationships
between
cloud reflectance
and cloud characteristics
have been illustrated
by
comparing
AVHRR
satellite data and aircraft measurements.
A relationship
of higher reflectances
from
smaller
cloud droplet
size spectra
is confirmed
for 3.7/_m
wavelength
(AVHRR
channel
3) and is
suggested
for 0.63 #m wavelength

1). A primary source of droplet size variations
is
related
to continental/marine
air mass differences.
