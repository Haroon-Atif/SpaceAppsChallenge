ABSTRACT:
A creep and creep damage
theory
is presented
for metallic
composites
with
strong
fibers.
Application
is to reinforced
structures
in which
the
fiber
orientation
may
vary
throughout
but a distinct
fiber direction
can be identified
locally
(local transverse
isotropy).
The creep deformation
model
follows earlier
work
and is based on a flow potential
function
that depends
on invariants
reflecting
stress
and the material
symmetry.
As the focus is on the interaction
of creep and damage,
primary
creep is ignored.
The creep
rupture
model
is an extension
of continuum
damage
mechanics
and includes
an isochronous
damage
function
that
depends
on
invariants
specifying
the local
maximum
transverse
tension
and the
maximum
longitudinal
shear
stress.
It is posited
that
at high temperature
and low stress,
appropriate
to engineering
practice,
these stress components
damage
the fiber/matrix
interface
through
diffusion
controlled
void growth,
eventually
causing
creep rupture.
Experiments
are outlined
for characterizing
a composite
through
creep rupture
tests
under transverse
tension
and longitudinal
shear. Application
is made to a thin-walled
pressure
vessel
with
reinforcing
fibers
at an arbitrary
helical
angle. The
results
illustrate
the
usefulness
of the model
as a means
of achieving
optimal
designs
of
composite
structures
where creep and creep rupture
are life limiting.

16. Abstract

A creep and creep damage theory is presented
for metallic composites
with strong fibers. Application
is to
reinforced
structures in which the fiber orientation
may vary throughout
but a distinct fiber direction can be
identified locally (local transverse
isotropy).
The creep deformation
model follows earlier work and is based on a
flow potential function that depends on invariants reflecting stress and the material symmetry.
As the focus is on
the interaction
of creep and damage, primary creep is ignored. The creep rupture model is an extension of
continuum
damage mechanics
and includes an isochronous
damage function that depends on invariants
specifying
the local maximum transverse
tension and the maximum longitudinal
shear stress. It is posited that at high
temperature
and low stress, appropriate

practice, these
